# Supplementary Documentation

This document provides additional details and supplementary information related to the paper "Pothole Detection in Asphalt Roads: A Comprehensive Approach for Enhanced Road Maintenance and Safety with AlexNet Model."

## Summary of Research

The research introduces an innovative approach for detecting potholes on asphalt roads using deep learning models, including AlexNet, ResNet-50, and VGG19Net. The primary focus is on improving road safety and maintenance efficiency.

## Key Findings

- **AlexNet** achieved the highest accuracy (92.15%) and F-score (96.52%) among the models tested.
- The model was trained on a robust dataset comprising images of both potholes and non-pothole road conditions, demonstrating high generalization capability.

## Additional Insights

- The preprocessing of the dataset involved image resizing, normalization, data augmentation, labeling, and splitting into training and testing sets.
- The performance of each model was evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.
